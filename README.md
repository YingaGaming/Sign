# Sign
Spigot plugin for signing items

## Usage
This plugin allows players to put signatures on items.

Just hold an item in your hand and run ``/sign [note]``

This will attach customizable lore to the item, and an optional note.

Signed items cannot be used normally, unless explicitly allowed in config.

## Permissions
- sign.create | Sign an item
- sign.note | Attach a note
- sign.use.bypass | Use all signed items

## Building
To build this plugin yourself, simply run ``mvn package``
